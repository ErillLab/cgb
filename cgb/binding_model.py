    """Definition for base class TFBindingModel.

    The TFBindingModel is an abstract class that supports arbitrary models for
    TF-binding estimated from the data, using a variety of ML paradigms. The
    TFBindingModel defines a scoring function for specific binding of a TF to a
    DNA sequence, together with a Bayesian statistical model for assessing the
    posterior probability of TF regulation for specific sequences.

    As such, it incorporates the following main methods:
    - A default constructor with known binding sites/regions and background
      sequences
    - A scoring function to score sequences
    - A method to report the score of known binding sites/regions
    - A method to define a threshold for score reporting
    - A method to set up the Bayesian estimator
    - A method to report posterior probabilities of TF regulation on sequences

    Its primary specification is the PSSMModel. See pssm_model.py
